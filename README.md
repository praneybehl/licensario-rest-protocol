# Licensario
These are the docs of Licensario's API, the online service for handling the provisioning and management of your 
users entitlements, hassle-free. Whether you want to integrate your brand new awesome Web 2.0 app or 
your rock-solid battle-proven desktop software with our service, this is the place for you.

# Products
* [Insight](https://github.com/Licensario/licensario-rest-protocol/blob/master/insight.md) - send your users activities to 
Licensario Servers (usually asynchronously). Use this if you already built your billing & entitlements management, 
but want to get pricing & packaging insights from Licensario.
* [Enforce](https://github.com/Licensario/licensario-rest-protocol/blob/master/insight.md) - send users activities and check their entitlements using Licensario. Use this if you already developed the billing layer, but would like to make use of Licensario pricing & packaging insights, do pricing & packaging A/B testing and provide a backend for your account managers.
* [Pro](https://github.com/Licensario/licensario-rest-protocol/blob/master/insight.md) - use this if you're a startup that didn't develop neither billing, neither entitlements management. The easiest integration possible, the broadest range of features for your marketing, product & C-level management.
